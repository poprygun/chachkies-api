# WIP: Spring Boot Kotlin application using OpenAPI (formerly Swagger Specification)

OpenApi UI will be generated during the runtime based on config/api.yml and available [here](http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html)

## Tests

Initialize tests can be generated by setting `generateApiTests.set(true)` in `build.gradle.kts`.
After that, move generated test file to `src/main` tree and implement test methods as needed.

## Local Development

Start the application locally

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Kubernetes environment

```bash
skaffold build
skaffold run
```
